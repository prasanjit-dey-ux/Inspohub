## 🎯 About

I kept wasting hours scrolling through generic design galleries—beautiful work, but nothing I could realistically build.

**INSPOSITE** is a curated collection of websites, portfolios, and tools that are evaluated for **buildability**, not just visual appeal.

If you code, design, or do both—this is inspiration you can actually use.

## ✨ What You'll Find

- **Portfolios** — Developer & designer portfolios worth studying
- **Inspiration** — Real-world websites with smart, practical design decisions
- **Tools** — UI libraries, AI tools, and utilities builders actually use
- **Quality over quantity** — Every entry is manually reviewed

No fluff. No clones. Just useful references.
